# Daemonic Lua API

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides Lua library definitions for **Daemonic**, enabling IntelliSense, autocompletion, and type checking for Daemonic-specific APIs.

This plugin is community driven, so it would not automatically get updates when Daemonic add new function, please add them by yourself or [create an issue](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-daemonic-api/issues/new) and describe what should be added

## Features

- Added all methods [official API documentation](https://daemonic.cc/estore/daemonic-api/)

Once installed, the extension will automatically add the Daemonic Lua definitions to your workspace. You can start using Daemonic APIs with full IntelliSense support.

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use Daemonic APIs with autocompletion and type checking:

```lua
---@type DMC
local dmc = ...

-- Use Daemonic APIs with IntelliSense support
dmc.ObjectExists("target") -- Autocompletion and type checking will work here
```
